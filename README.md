# ahime-server
Server side of a full stack MERN ecommerce project

https://github.com/YellowFlash2012/ahime-server.git

Key learning points:
1- learned how to use "concurrently" to run both client and server from a single command line
2- how to turn nodejs imports into es5 module imports by adding "type":"module" to the package.json file
3- learned how to use the data seeder script to create a batch of products in the db with one command line. Never heard of it before but now when I come tot hink of it, it makes sense. Adding products manually to the db must be painful especially when we are dealing with hundreds of products!
